# Homely
An app for hostelers and people living alone

This app would enable a person to keep track and remind important tasks like electricity bill payment ,rent payment,etc...It would enable us to split the commodities we use as kitchen,stationary, toiletries,etc...and would help us keep a tally on the amount of each item under different categories so that we will get alerted when we run out of a particular item.The alert can either be based on always have atleast one stock protocol for eg. If we had just one paste left and we have started using it then we must update it to the app and the app will ask us to restock the paste before the present one runs out or any number of stocks as per the user's desire.And for commodities like food items it may work on the basis of a set timeline asin if we bought 1 month's worth of ingredients it must still remind us to buy items 1 week prior to the end of that month.We will also be able to set reminders like eat healthy food ,drink more water in the app,turn off the lights,clean the rooms etc...And must be able to properly document the month's expense  or any expenditure in a very systematic and user friendly manner.It must also have a special emergency section dedicated to help the person in case of medical or any other emergencies...
