Errors:
We are facing trouble with STMP port setting and its other settings.Hence we wont be able to send the mail as of now.But,we will work on it and make our website into a fully functional dynamic website.
we are also facing trouble in hosting php pages as github doesnt support dynamic websites and almost all other trustworthy sites are paid.
